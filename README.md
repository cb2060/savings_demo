# Readme example

Since this is a demo I thought I might show basic Markdown syntax for Readme files

Titles and headers can be made in six different sizes by adding `#` before the text in the following manner.

```
# Size 1
```
# Size 1

```
## Size 2
```
## Size 2

and so on, with a maximum of six `#`

*Italics* is made with asterisks or underscores: `*italics*`, `_italics_`

**Bold** is made with double asterisks or double underscores: `**Bold**`, `__Bold__`

This two character system is implemented in order to allow __combinations of *italics* and bold__ (`__combinations of *italics* and bold__`)

Furthermore, ~~scratching~~ is made with `~~scratching~~`

Inline `code` is placed between backticks (
\`code\`)

Code blocks are fenced by three bacticks (after the opening backticks you can specify the language in order to obtain highlighting):
```

```python
if len(geneLists)<1:
        geneLists = genes # save this list
...

```

```python
if len(geneLists)<1:
        geneLists = genes # save this list
```

Many more things can be done in Markdown, a more comprehensive list (and additional sources) can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
